We have built a prototype and successfully tested it in the practical environment. In accordance with the legislation in accordance with IMO - Marpol-BLU code - and IMSBC we also rewrote from separate procedure and adapted to the so-called Tuit trimming. Since there is no physical contact with the ship’s walls, and the ship, no damage is caused to the construction of the ship, the coating construction is not damaged. This results in more safety for ships and its passengers. With our machine and unloading procedure, we clean vessels in accordance with the current regulations and the current Ballast Water Management. This results in less sea pollution, increased safety for dock workers and less damage to the harbor receiving installation with our discharge procedure." },

The two most outstanding advantages are the speed of the cleaning, that can be performed in just two hours, and the low cleaning costs per linear meter. The net balance is a huge savings in the fuel costs and a considerable reduction of the carbon dioxide emissions. Scheduling quick pit-stops, will make possible to run the fleet at maximum efficiency, while avoiding to wait for RINA inspections to proceed with expensive maintenance and the rebuilding of protective and antifouling paints." }
