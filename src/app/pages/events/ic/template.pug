        p The Innovation Challenge is a two-way opportunity for creative-minded students and business organizations. The students, guided by experienced mentors, are able to liberate their imagination and solve business-related problems, while the companies benefit from the ideas of fresh-minded students. During the challenge, the participants will investigate a real-life case, form teams, brainstorm solutions and pitch their ideas to the judges. The best idea wins the award!
