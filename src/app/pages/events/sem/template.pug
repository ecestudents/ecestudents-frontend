        p The Social Entrepreneurship Masterclass (SEM) is an event designed to coach students about starting their own social enterprise. Student teams take part in practical workshops and develop a business plan that tackles a social issue. In the end, participants pitch their ideas to a jury - and the winners will get to participate in ECE's 12-week startup programme. Get Started!
