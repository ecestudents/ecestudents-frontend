        h3 Who are we?
        p Since its establishment in 2013, ECE Students has grown to be the largest entrepreneurial student association of Erasmus University Rotterdam (EUR), while seeking to contribute to a true culture of innovation and entrepreneurship in the city of Rotterdam. Leaving behind old, cumbersome association structures – and with the support of our alumni and current active members – we created a modern and transparent association in aim to provide the right tools and resources for the entrepreneurial-minded across campus.
        p We provide all the resources — coaching, network, working space — to help anyone bring their ideas into the real world. Do you feel ready? Because we are.
